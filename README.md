# python-import-with-relative-path-example

This is a simple example of how to import a module from a relative path.

The following steps are required to make this work:

1. Create a folder with the name of your package. In this example, the package is called `afolder`.
2. Create a file called `__init__.py` inside the package folder. This file is required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages.
3. Create a file called `asource.py` inside the package folder. This file contains the code that you want to import.
4. Create a file called `bsource.py` in the `bsource` relative folder. This file contains the code that you want to run.
5. In the `main.py` file, import the `bsource` module using a relative path.
6. Run the `main.py` file.
